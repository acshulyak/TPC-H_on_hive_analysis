#TPC-H On Hive Analysis

This project provides the tools necessary to collect a variety of performance metrics on Hive and MySQL with the TPC-H benchmark suite. These tests were done with a single-node setup in all cases. In this README, I will detail the steps necessary to recreate my experiments.

#Setup
- Hive on Hadoop: Follow the instruction found at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hive/hive_installation.htm to install Hadoop and Hive. It includes instruction to install all the dependencies necessary.
- Tez: Download tez veresion that was used in our study (0.7.1) from http://archive.apache.org/dist/tez/0.7.0/apache-tez-0.7.0-src.tar.gz or download the latest from https://tez.apache.org/releases/index.html. Uncompress the source and follow the instructions in BUILDING.txt in the root directory. By following those instructions, the file INSTALL.md will be generated. Follow those instructions as well.
